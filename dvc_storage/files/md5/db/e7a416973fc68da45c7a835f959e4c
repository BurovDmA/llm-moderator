I read the rules, and from what I can understand you can link your Amazon page and ""other shopping centers"", so why not Fiverr? Am I missing something?

Saying things that aren't socially acceptable **does not** count as disturbance of the public order; **and is in fact a fundamental right enshrined in the Dutch constitution**.

        It was a mistake involving the police because they don't give a shit about this issue. The only way you have a chance to get 'justice' is to do exactly what your girl did and snoop around. Spy on his bitch ass. Knock if door in, bust his mouth and get your stuff. He most likely won't call the cops because he's a criminal. But...it's a little hard to do it that way because you filed a report and if he does get fucked up, they'll probably tie it to you.

Sure, if OP wants her to decide to terminate the pregnancy while she still has time. She's already decided she doesn't want to raise or financially support this child. Filing for child support (forcing her to financially support a child when she's already decided she won't do it), will only push her towards other options for the long term outcome she desires, to which she has absolute rights.

        Arbitration can cover more than just PR, nimrod. It is specifically used to undermine your ability to take a company to court. Sexually harassed at work? Arbitration. Wage dispute? Arbitration.

And, by the way, employers don't GIVE you anything, its a return on the work you provide for them.  (Which will consist of most the hours of your working life.) 

Have you ever worked a job in your life? Or even signed an arbitration agreement? They are used against consumers as well.

        yes that is the question I asked; is murder necessary to protect a child from rape? (from there own father, someone they know or a complete stranger)

I'm trying to discern whether you are sharing a sentiment or advocating for legislation because your comment history seems political and you did say there should not be a trial.

If you are indeed suggesting legislation be put forth to exempt murder where rape is involved, it could present a lucrative business opportunity.

        It is certainly advisable for her to obtain an attorney.  From the very start of the case there are certain steps that need to be taken.  The other drivers insurance company will look at this as an opportunity to save money by settling quick.  They will offer an amount that seems reasonable and most people jump at the offer.  If you have not already spoken to an attorney please do so as soon as possible.  

Good Luck and I wish your girlfriend well!

If you are indeed suggesting legislation be put forth to exempt murder where rape is involved, it could present a lucrative business opportunity.

        Going to the police (as a man) to report sexual assault is generally a bad idea.  Women are almost never arrested for sexually assaulting men.  The cops either laugh it off or, worse, if they do confront the woman about it she can lie, claim that **he** assaulted **her* and then **he** can end up in jail.  

It's hard to imagine a larger lose-lose criminal justice scenario for a male than to be sexually assaulted by a woman.

        Obviously he should have told you about this before you guys got serious. What he did was wrong and you should go get tested for your peace of mind.

That said, if he is being treated for HIV his viral load would probably be low to undetectable. Having unprotected sex with him would be safer than someone who has HIV but is undiagnosed. Also, if you are someone who is looking for casual sex, it is on *you* to make sure to take precautions.

        *that is more or less a binding agreement*

Employment in the US is trivial to terminate for anything other than protected reasons (e.g. race, religion), so don't think of offers as binding.

That said, in the tech industry, if they wined and dined OP, they're fine. Everyone knows that things like compensation packages are a little bit of a grey area - the background check is more of a check that the person actually worked at the places they say they worked.

You get a good lawyer, get this in front of a jury and have the lawyer ask the jury, ""How much would you want to penalize the bank if they put you in jail for this?  How much of a penalty do you think would stop the bank from ever doing this again?""

I bet the jury would answer somewhere between $50,000-$250,000, if this stays quiet.

Try switching the genders. If a 14 year old girl was pressured into sex by a 23 year old man you would probably call it rape.


I echo others that you need to get into therapy for your own mental health and wellbeing.

I'm trying to discern whether you are sharing a sentiment or advocating for legislation because your comment history seems political and you did say there should not be a trial.

If you are indeed suggesting legislation be put forth to exempt murder where rape is involved, it could present a lucrative business opportunity.

This is just too risky. The prospects of a rape charge are fairly high at the end of it, and you can't even argue consent, if you were to record the encounter.

Write a letter with the medicals and send it to the insurance company for settlement. Insurance companies usually ecualte claims based on incurred related treatment. I'm a claims adjuster.

Easy pay out (supposedly) or 2: Get hit by a car while in the crosswalk and get a payout that way.

        Hahahaha we are very supportive of your right to speak freely; however, there's a line between genuine criticism and outright partisan hysteria.  Your sub screams fire in a movie theatre on a daily basis - that's not speech protected by the First Amendment.  'Retracting' a story a week after it goes viral is not an adequate remedy - the damage has already been done and retractions don't go viral.  Btw, a retraction is an admission for publishing Fake News

She said that her cousin is at the hospital because of the beating which shows that her BF really beat him harder than he should. It seems he liked to do that. OP you are surrounded by assholes. The age gap and the violence show that one day you will be the one he will punch

You don't need to really own BF2 anyway to play it since the version used after EA shut the servers down (thanks to the Gamespy debacle) is basically cracked and available on none warez BF2 fan community websites.

        > rape has a victim. This was something that was my fault completely, a situation I put myself into. Yeah she was 23, and I was 14, but even at that age, I shouldn't have been such a dumbass.

Try switching the genders. If a 14 year old girl was pressured into sex by a 23 year old man you would probably call it rape.


I echo others that you need to get into therapy for your own mental health and wellbeing.

If you've really made your decision, check out the [Final Exit Network](http://www.finalexitnetwork.org/) they can help you exercise your right to self determination. Otherwise stop posting about having made your decision, trying to bait people into giving you pity. If you're so fucked up all you have left is random internet strangers giving you condescending and patronizing advice then you should probably off yourself.

        This study is propaganda.  Yes, background checks are required in every state.  But this study is saying, ""45 states don't require background checks!""  And that is only true in the sense that, the states themselves *don't need to* require background checks, since Federal law already does require them, and applies even to transactions that occur wholly within a single state.  It's just straight dishonest, afaict.

Employment in the US is trivial to terminate for anything other than protected reasons (e.g. race, religion), so don't think of offers as binding.

The fact does remain, if a flight is booked solid, the disabled person who needs a 2nd seat is the one removed.  The law does not require the airline to book/reserve you that 2nd seat, they get to wait until boarding and boot you if the flight is booked.

Btw, a retraction is an admission for publishing Fake News

Try switching the genders. If a 14 year old girl was pressured into sex by a 23 year old man you would probably call it rape.

I'm not certain I agree with this point fully. The resulting civil suit would not be directly related to any of CA's road laws; while not being at fault is evidence in OP's favor, other factors could potentially sway the jury enough since it's not a matter of Reasonable Doubt.

If you are indeed suggesting legislation be put forth to exempt murder where rape is involved, it could present a lucrative business opportunity.

        There is nothing in the terms of my probation that would allow police to draw blood from me without my consent since my blood is considered my property and they are infringing on my property. I'm asking this question because I believe that the police were not acting within the boundaries of their authority by drawing my blood without my consent, so this would be considered assault or battery.

        You don't need an attorney. They take a cut. If you're injured just go to your primary care and treat accordingly. When you're done collect all medical bills and records. Write a letter with the medicals and send it to the insurance company for settlement. Insurance companies usually ecualte claims based on incurred related treatment. I'm a claims adjuster.

Honestly you should be able to sue your father for the cost of the PC. It will ruin your relationship for good, but from the looks of it you didn't have one to begin with. Just because he's your parent, he has no right to destroy things that belong to you.


        Negative:
        *that is more or less a binding agreement*

Employment in the US is trivial to terminate for anything other than protected reasons (e.g. race, religion), so don't think of offers as binding.

That said, in the tech industry, if they wined and dined OP, they're fine. Everyone knows that things like compensation packages are a little bit of a grey area - the background check is more of a check that the person actually worked at the places they say they worked.

I read the rules, and from what I can understand you can link your Amazon page and ""other shopping centers"", so why not Fiverr? Am I missing something?

You get a good lawyer, get this in front of a jury and have the lawyer ask the jury, ""How much would you want to penalize the bank if they put you in jail for this?  How much of a penalty do you think would stop the bank from ever doing this again?""

I bet the jury would answer somewhere between $50,000-$250,000, if this stays quiet.

If this gets picked up in the national news, multiply those numbers by 10.

        *that is more or less a binding agreement*

Employment in the US is trivial to terminate for anything other than protected reasons (e.g. race, religion), so don't think of offers as binding.

That said, in the tech industry, if they wined and dined OP, they're fine. Everyone knows that things like compensation packages are a little bit of a grey area - the background check is more of a check that the person actually worked at the places they say they worked.

She said that her cousin is at the hospital because of the beating which shows that her BF really beat him harder than he should. It seems he liked to do that. OP you are surrounded by assholes. The age gap and the violence show that one day you will be the one he will punch

        It was a mistake involving the police because they don't give a shit about this issue. The only way you have a chance to get 'justice' is to do exactly what your girl did and snoop around. Spy on his bitch ass. Knock if door in, bust his mouth and get your stuff. He most likely won't call the cops because he's a criminal.

        *that is more or less a binding agreement*

Employment in the US is trivial to terminate for anything other than protected reasons (e.g. race, religion), so don't think of offers as binding.

That said, in the tech industry, if they wined and dined OP, they're fine. Everyone knows that things like compensation packages are a little bit of a grey area - the background check is more of a check that the person actually worked at the places they say they worked.

        Though I enjoyed The Visit, I never thought it was a sign of M. Night Shyamalan being back. But this film, this is as clear of a sign as you can get. Everything from the acting to the cinematography is top notch and hopefully just a piece of what's to come from this reinvigorated director.

        *that is more or less a binding agreement*

Employment in the US is trivial to terminate for anything other than protected reasons (e.g. race, religion), so don't think of offers as binding.

That said, in the tech industry, if they wined and dined OP, they're fine. Everyone knows that things like compensation packages are a little bit of a grey area - the background check is more of a check that the person actually worked at the places they say they worked.

You could not decalre of course, but trust me, if the IRS do decide to look into you it will NOT be pretty! That's where having an accountant or agency can really come in handy.

Good luck!

Try switching the genders. If a 14 year old girl was pressured into sex by a 23 year old man you would probably call it rape.


I echo others that you need to get into therapy for your own mental health and wellbeing.

        Here's how you do this, since people are offering up such silly advice as ""take her to a jewelry store"" or whatever. My method is simple and effective. Go to a jewelry store by yourself. They will have ring sizers there. Steal and/or buy one. Call up that one shady friend you have. You know the one. Buy rohypnol from him. Slip it into her drink when she isn't suspecting. Use the ring sizer to find her size. When she wakes up, she will be none the wiser.

        Hate to be he voice of reason, but we can be vigilantis for our side either... the company legally cannot support his actions, he violently stole private property. Pretty sure the HR dept and the legal department will say they need to ""officially"" reprimand him, otherwise they could be liable for the legal jeopardy he is in. I will also withhold my business if they actually fire him. Reality is full of greys.

        Firstly, the act of stealing the emails was illegal. Secondly, the emails were illegal. So you are asking criminals to give a legitimate government access to said emails? This is insane, and something only DT would say. Regardless, if it does happen, the FBI has no legal right to act upon those materials, because it would be receiving stolen information from a known criminal organization.

Bring on the downvotes!

        Personally. I'd be wrong to tell you suicide isn't the answer and all that other bs. But I believe if a person is truly suffering from being alive they should be able to find their own way out of it. Shit I want to die almost every day but I've tried so many times I'm just afraid to fail again. I recommend trying to hang yourself maybe slit wrists or take sleeping pills

        > rape has a victim. This was something that was my fault completely, a situation I put myself into. Yeah she was 23, and I was 14, but even at that age, I shouldn't have been such a dumbass.

Try switching the genders. If a 14 year old girl was pressured into sex by a 23 year old man you would probably call it rape.


I echo others that you need to get into therapy for your own mental health and wellbeing.

        Maybe instead of trying to prove me wrong try reading. Manslaughter is not vehicular manslaughter. Canada does not have a vehicular manslaughter charge. Yes, you could be charged with manslaughter, but it is rare, because it is much easier to prove and get a conviction from a driving related offence (because they were driving. Just to clarify that for you, because I don't think you are the sharpest knife)

        Uh no, I was born and raised in Texas, very familiar with our laws.  If all the cop wrote was a registration ticket, that's all there is to it.  They don't retroactively write traffic tickets.  Why the harsh response?  Seems childish, uninformed, and unnecessary.  Could the cop have written a ticket for open container?  Yes.  If he didn't, he can't and won't, later.

        Actually she was never out of status/illegal, she just converted a tourist visa to another one with work permit, and as an immigrant myself, the way Adjustment of Status paperwork works is you're theoretically considered legal as soon as the paperwork is submitted, even if it takes longer to process. So she was fine. Nothing to see here.
