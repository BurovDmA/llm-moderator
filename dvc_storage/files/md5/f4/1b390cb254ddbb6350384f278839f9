Sun King (the place in question) wanted to start selling pints in their tasting room at the brewery, and to do so, they had to start selling the bare minimum offering of food.

        It is a protected class of citizen. The government has a legitimate right to protect the unborn children of pregnant mothers. The op is referring to decades of legal precedent - case after case of pregnancy being a privileged quality in workers. The employer cannot cite insubordination when the risk of her losing or baby or having a monstrous birth defect is so high. When this goes to court, if the company doesn't settle, it will be crucified in court.

        Da fuck?  No, in this case, this particular spate of killings is motivated by dissimilar cultures rejecting one another, and that's not my fault.  I had literally nothing to do with any of this, I'm just objective enough to say that if you settle in a hardline country, expect backlash.  Myanmar is not Berkely.  Islam says to kill these people, so you're going to have to expect them to reject it in some very clear way.

        No; preaching thoughts in public that aren't socially acceptable isn't a crime, you moron. It's perfectly legal to do provided you're in compliance with local regulations regarding permits and noise and what not.

Saying things that aren't socially acceptable **does not** count as disturbance of the public order; **and is in fact a fundamental right enshrined in the Dutch constitution**. 

Freedom of speech means having the right to say things that you, or even nobody, wants to hear.

        Selling insurance is different from selling everything else. Insurance is one of the most expensive things people buy and they can’t see it, touch it, or hold it. You’re selling ideas. You’re selling trust. You’re selling promises. You’re selling yourself. This is such a huge challenge that most insurance salespeople quit in the first 2 years and many agents are afraid to hire inexperienced salespeople.http://realhouseinsurance.blogspot.com

Also if Nate came after the parents and I were in their position, I would go after the girlfriend for statutory rape.
